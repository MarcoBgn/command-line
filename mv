The mv command is mainly used to move files and directory from the command line. 

  Syn: $ mv test.txt new/dir/
  
It can also be useful to rename a file, when no new destination is specified: 
  
  Syn: $ mv test.txt test_newname.txt
  
Useful options are: 

  -v - returns the action 
  -i - Asks for confirmation before overwriting a file
