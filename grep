The grep command is commonly used to search regular expressions inside files, or after a pipeline to chain outputs. 

  Syn: $ grep cafe test.txt  - will look for a line inside the file test.txt with the word "cafe" in it. 
  
  Syn: $ env | grep ^T     - Will print a list of Environment variables that start with a capital T. 
  
A similar command is egrep, and it is used with ERE's (Extended Regular Expressions).
